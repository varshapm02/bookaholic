This project is a Low-Level Design (LLD) implementation of a Library Management System in Java. It demonstrates core object-oriented design concepts, SOLID principles, and the use of interfaces where abstraction is needed.  The system allows managing books, patrons (members), and lending operations, while keeping track of inventory details.
